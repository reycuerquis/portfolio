                  <p><strong>Rapid Transformational Therapy&reg;</strong> embraces many of the positive aspects of <u>hypnosis and hypnotherapy</u> that are known to produce a transformative effect on clients, including the use of trance and hypnotic conditioning.</p>
                  <p>However, <strong>RTT&reg; goes beyond hypnosis</strong>, diagnosing what works with clients to build a new therapeutic approach. Unlike traditional hypnotherapy, RTT&reg; does not rely solely on positive reinforcement.</p>
                  <p>While using correct, up-to-date, and relevant language when talking to yourself is certainly a part of any transformation, it serves as more of a reinforcement of breakthroughs rather than the catalyst. RTT&reg; therapists could reach breakthroughs via hypnosis that would not be possible if they were simply trying to access the subconscious mind via altered language and self-talk.</p>
                  <p>Your RTT&reg; therapist is equipped with an array of techniques and tools that are crucial, not just in teaching you how to communicate with your subconscious mind but also directly accessing and fixing whatever blocks may be there. Central to that is the ability to transform many clients in a single session</p>
                  <div class="header">
                    <p>How Does it Work?</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Marisa identified that regardless of their issue, clients benefit from applying a particular set of techniques in a specific way that almost always brings about phenomenal changes. These insights provided the foundations for Rapid Transformational Therapy® to emerge as a distinctive therapeutic approach.</p>
                  <p>Marisa has developed a <strong>unique therapy</strong> and a range of techniques and tools that your therapist may draw on depending on a client’s presenting challenges by diagnosing what works with real clients in real sessions. Your RTT&reg; therapist is trained to use these tools in a skillful and exploratory way following extensive training, ongoing support, and supervision.</p>
                  <div class="header">
                    <p>What Should I Expect From a Session?</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>You will work with your RTT&reg; therapist to uncover the meaning and interpretation of events in your life and then change them.</p>
                  <p>This leads to permanent, powerful results. RTT&reg; works by empowering the mind to tell the body what to do, for example, heal itself using a technique called Command Therapy, easily move away from addictions, and turn fear into excitement. RTT&reg; can tell the body how to react and how to feel, and it can alter and improve the messages the body sends to the mind so things like depression, anxiety, and panic attacks can be permanently overcome.</p>
                  <p>If you are in physical or emotional pain, you want rapid results. RTT&reg; aims to deliver permanent change in one to three sessions. RTT&reg; recognizes and values the significance clients attach to their issues/problems, and then offers a powerful emotional release. You can be free from pain.</p>
                  <p>RTT&reg; also uses Command Cell therapy as a technique for purposefully healing the body instead of positive conditioning alone. RTT&reg; draws out “unfinished business,” meaning it is a technique for addressing the trauma that clients have held onto for many years.</p>

                      <p>“When it came time to create my therapy course after thirty years of practicing it myself, I really wanted to create something powerful and transformational that reflected all the success I’ve had in my long career. I also wanted to be very clear about what it is. It’s true that I’ve been influenced by lots of methodologies including <strong>hypnosis, CBT, psychotherapy, psychology, healing, and Neuro Linguistic Programming (or NLP)</strong>. However, it would be incorrect to say my method is simply a summation of these parts. I truly believe my method, Rapid Transformational Therapy® (RTT®), is one-of-a-kind and its foundation is guided by the unconventional idea that you don’t need a lifetime to learn, master and then change the processes of the mind, nor weekly sessions. With the right therapist you can become free of problems like depression, anxiety, all addictions, confidence issues, weight issues, fears and phobias very quickly.”</p>

                      Marisa Peer’s RTT&reg; method is different to other therapy techniques, such as CBT and talk therapy, because it achieves outstanding results very quickly. RTT&reg; is becoming more recognized and validated on a regular basis with course graduates reporting near-immediate success.
                    </p></small>
                    <small><p>
                      Unlike many hypnotherapy treatments, RTT&reg; does not rely solely on positive reinforcement. RTT&reg; therapy gets to the root cause of an issue, giving the clients the most liberating understanding and transformative power to achieve dramatic long lasting results.

                      People who have heard of the RTT&reg; method, but not experienced it for themselves, sometimes think it sounds similar to Neuro-Linguistic Processing (NLP).
                    </p></small>
                    <small><p>
                      It’s true that both NLP and RTT&reg; can teach you how to better dialogue with your mind, and understand the difference between what your subconscious and conscious mind believe. However, RTT&reg; has the added—and crucial—step of also directly accessing and fixing whatever blocks may be there. It has the addition of ‘The Transformation’, developed by Marisa herself. Using specific RTT&reg; therapy methods, clients are able to reach breakthroughs that would not be possible with other techniques.

                      RTT&reg; accreditation is different to other qualifications as the training is very hands-on and practical, taught at the highest educational standard. RTT&reg; training includes continuous practice sessions to master the method, guided support, regular masterminds to dive deeper into topics, plus a community of peers and RTT&reg; Graduates on hand to assist with any questions.

                      “I am a great believer that you cannot fix what you don’t understand and RTT&reg; works by first understanding how you got your issues and then freeing you from them for good by understanding the Role, Function and Purpose of the issue.” - Marisa Peer.

                      Science has proven with neuroplasticity that we can actually rewire our minds, which is why it has the most powerful potential on the planet. Using RTT&reg; to access the almighty subconscious mind, we can create new neural pathways and replace old limiting beliefs and behaviours with new empowering ones.

                    <p>She is an amazing woman and inspiring role model! Marisa is a fun and phenomenal teacher and I couldn’t have asked for a better one! It was an honour to be trained by her and I’m forever grateful!</p>
                    <p>When I first learned about Marisa, I knew right away that I want to do what she does and I knew that I will be able to help a lot of people and first of all myself! And I did, big time!! My life will never be the same and I have Marisa Peer to thank for it.</p>
                    <p>Celebrate your teachers today! What teacher changed your life? Who would you like to say Thank you to?? #thankteacher #teacherappreciation.”</p>

                    <p>The amount of people I’ve helped & seen transform through what I’ve learnt, for me, goes far beyond what I invested. Yes, it’s a lot of money, but every single penny has been worth it, not only from my clients but my own healing too. The memories I uncovered held such deep rooted issues & if I’d never seen a client then that shift alone would have been worth it. To give freedom to a struggling teen or a gorgeous 30 year old who didn’t see her own worth has been life changing. It’s become a passion that has purpose & I feel incredibly proud to say I’m an RTT® Practitioner.”</p>

You may. Remember that I did a RTT® session with her October 2018. Her specialist said that all her joints are fine and she doesn’t need to go back for 6 months! This means that she is pain free, symptom free, no medication, no bloody tests, no 3 monthly appointments. In short it means that she is free to be herself! Thank you Marisa for this wonderful gift! I simply do not have the right words to express my gratitude and love for you.”</p>

                    <p>“Hi, I’m a master practitioner of NLP, Time Line Therapy and Hypnotherapy. TLT in a nutshell is like imagining a timeline that you zoom up and down, going from past lives, the past, the future etc. You then observe the scene from different angles; high up if client too emotional or drop down into the scene (so associating and disassociating), then as a third party if you like for an objective view. I didn’t enjoy it (nor NLP if I’m honest), it seemed to elicit very strong emotions/reactions and people would be literally losing it in the room</p>
                    <p>😀 You’re taught to use the script exactly as set out without deviation, as the founder Tad James has trademarked it (and you must use the trademark sign too). It works on the theory that if you get to the root, it is like a gestalt - so once you clear that issue, it will then knock out the rest in that string of thoughts... imagine like breaking a string of pearls. It wasn’t for me but maybe some people find it useful. RTT® is infinitely more useful, maleable, successful and ultimately beneficial.”</p>

I have now given around 200 sessions and reached around 500 through the group sessions I have given. That’s a whole lotta life changing going on! I knew as soon as I took the leap and signed up back in January 2018, that RTT® was my calling. I had no idea it would lead this far though and it is only growing as I continue to develop my eight week programme (The Red Tent) for women with cyclical emotional / mental health issues (PMDD/PME/severe PMS). To all of you in this beautiful group who have supported me and shared so much wisdom, thank you. And of course THANK YOU to the boss lady herself Marisa Peer.
